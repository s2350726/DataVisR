Welcome to the first data visualization project for this DataVisR series. The theme of this project is... Music!
I was inspired by Priya Padham's beautiful music data visualization project in Tableau [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/p.padham/viz/DataPlusMusicPinkFloyd-TheGreatGigInTheSky/TheGreatGigintheSky].
With my loving mother in mind, I have visualized the song Mas Que Nada by Sergio Mendes and The Black Eyed Peas with data from a MIDI Sequence file. 
In this project, I developed my data wrangling and visualization skills in R with tidyverse, ggplot2, and shiny on time-series data from a MIDI Sequence file.
I am happy with the current state, but I want to simplify the plots and expand on the songs with It Ain't Me.
In the future, I hope to develop products with more substance to develop my data storytelling abilities.
